        "\n",
        "**Driven Like The Snow** (17) and **1959** (15) make strong showings for songs that have never been performed in the live set, speaking to the enduring strength of the Floodland material.\n",

        "For one of the better songs on its album **Possession** (3) has surprisingly few covers. Is this one hard to play, or hard to sing? Same could be said about **Ribbons** (6).\n",
        "\n",
        "The Steinman collaborations (This Corrosion, Dominion/Mother Russia and More) account for 10.6% of the total covers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Of the released material, I didn't find any covers of **Watch** and **Phantom**. I'm not surprised by the latter. But Watch deserves a cover or two - it lasted longer in the live set than Damage and the later iterations were better than the released single.\n",
        "\n",
        "Including unreleased material: **Driver**, **Wide Receiver**, **Better Reptile** and **I Will Call You** are not represented in the data set (I didn't consider Body Politic and Burn It Down to be unique tracks). Wide Receiver is garbage, but Driver is a good song and I was surprised not to find any covers. For the two recent songs I guess we need Von to tell us the actual lyrics before anyone tries them. Maybe a cover that embraces the indistinct mumbling is the way to go?"

There is a cluster of metalheads who have redone the well-known Cradle Of Filth cover (not all of who seem to realise it's originally from the Sisters) making it arguably the most influential Sisters cover in any genre. **This Corrosion** (28%), **Black Planet** (25%) and **More** (25%) are other favourites in this genre. **Alice** (2%) has the fewest metal covers.\n",

        "Sorting total covers by era, the **Floodland** \"line-up\" (314) is well out ahead as the most covered, mostly due to the volume of Lucretia (note that I included The Sisterhood tracks in this line-up bucket which may not be entirely fair). **FALAA** (266) and **Reptile House** (263)are pretty even behind that. Despite being an actual live line-up the **Vision Thing** songs (112) are a lot less popular with covering artists. One could make a case for splitting the post-VT live line-ups by lead guitarist or something but I couldn't be arsed.\n",
